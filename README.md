# Seed Sowing with Weed Removal Robot

This project introduces an innovative agricultural robot designed to automate seed sowing, weed removal, and moisture detection. By integrating Arduino, Bluetooth communication, and motor control mechanisms, the robot aims to enhance farming efficiency and reduce manual labor.

## Project Description
The **Seed Sowing with Weed Removal Robot** is an intelligent agricultural mechanism designed to address common challenges faced by farmers. Traditional methods of seed sowing and weed removal are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inefficiencies. This robot is built to simplify these processes using automation.

The robot combines hardware components such as an Arduino microcontroller, Bluetooth module, motor driver, servo motors, and moisture sensors to perform multiple tasks effectively. With remote control functionality via a mobile app, the robot can be guided through the field to sow seeds and remove weeds without extensive manual intervention. 

The seed sowing system ensures precise seed placement at appropriate intervals, reducing seed wastage and improving crop yield. The integrated moisture sensor evaluates soil conditions before planting, ensuring seeds are sown in optimal moisture levels for improved germination rates. The weed removal mechanism employs rotating blades or cutters to eliminate unwanted plants, minimizing competition for nutrients and maximizing crop growth.
